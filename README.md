## Brunel-Car-Park
Coursework task for the Network Computing module. The goal was to create a multi-threaded client/server system that shows how a car park management system keeps track of spaces available in the car park.

The system has:

* Two entrance clients.
* Two exit clients.
* One server managing the spaces using a locking system.

There are five spaces in the car park, so cars are forced to queue at the entrances if the spaces are taken.
